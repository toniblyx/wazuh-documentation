Configuring generic email options
---------------------------------
In order to configure Wazuh to send alerts through email, you need to configure the email settings inside the ``<global>`` section:

::

  <ossec_config>
      <global>
          <email_notification>yes</email_notification>
          <email_to>me@test.com</email_to>
          <smtp_server>mail.test.com..</smtp_server>
          <email_from>wazuh@test.com</email_from>
      </global>
      ...
  </ossec_config>

To see all the available options to configure it, go to :ref:`global section <reference_ossec_global>`

After the global configuration, we need to configure the ``email_alert_level``. This option stablishs the minimum level to send an alert. By default is set to 7.

::

  <ossec_config>
    <alerts>
        <email_alert_level>10</email_alert_level>
    </alerts>
    ...
  </ossec_config>

This example will set the minimum level to 10. More information: :ref:`alerts section <reference_ossec_global>`.

Once you have configured the ``alert_level``, Wazuh needs to be restarted for the change take effect

a) For Systemd:
::

  systemctl status wazuh-manager

b) For SysV Init:
::

  service wazuh-manager status


.. warning::
 Wazuh doesn't handle smtp authentication. If you want to use an email with it, you need to :ref:`configure a server relay<smtp_authentication>`.


Configuring granular email options
----------------------------------

Wazuh also allows a very granular configuration options for your alerts through email. Here you will find some examples about the granular configuration. More info: :ref:`email_alerts section <reference_ossec_global>`

.. warning::

  The minimum level you configured inside ``alerts`` section, will be also valid here.

So, for example, if you configure your system to send email once the rule 526 is triggered, if that rule has a level lower than the configured on the previous section the alert will not be sent.

Email alert based on level
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The general configuration will be:
::

 <email_alerts>
   <email_to>you@example.com</email_to>
   <level>4</level>
   <do_not_delay />
 </email_alerts>

This will send to ``you@example`` and email if the any rule with level greater or equal to 10 is triggered. Remember, if the level here is less than the email_alert_level configured on the previous section, this will not be sent.

Email alert based on level and agent
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The general configuration will be:
::

 <email_alerts>
   <email_to>you@example.com</email_to>
   <event_location>server1</event_location>
   <do_not_delay />
 </email_alerts>

This will send to ``you@example`` and email if the for the rules triggered on the ``server1``.
Also, ``event_location`` can be configured to monitor a specific log, hostname or network (IP)

Email based on rules ID
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
::

 <email_alerts>
   <email_to>you@example.com</email_to>
   <rule_id>515, 516</rule_id>
   <do_not_delay />
 </email_alerts>

This will send an email if the rules 515 or 516 are triggered on any agent.

Email based on the group
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each rule can have one or more groups configured. We can use this groups to filter the rules that we want to send through email:
::

 <email_alerts>
   <email_to>you@example.com</email_to>
   <group>pci_dss_10.6.1</group>
 </email_alerts>

This will send an alert if any rule part of the ``pci_dss_10.6.1`` group is triggered on any machine.

Multiples options and multiples email
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This example will show you the real capacity of this capability:

::

 <ossec_config>
   <email_alerts>
       <email_to>alice@test.com</email_to>
       <event_location>server1|server2</event_location>
   </email_alerts>
   <email_alerts>
       <email_to>is@test.com</email_to>
       <event_location>/log/secure$</event_location>
   </email_alerts>
   <email_alerts>
       <email_to>bob@test.com</email_to>
       <event_location>192.168.</event_location>
   </email_alerts>
   <email_alerts>
       <email_to>david@test.com</email_to>
       <level>12</level>
   </email_alerts>
  </ossec_config>

This configuration will send:

- An email to alice@test.com if any alert on server1 or server2 is triggered
- An email to is@test.com if the alerts came from ``/log/secure/``
- An email tto bob@test.com if the alerts came from any machine on the ``192.168.0.0/24`` network
- An email tto david@test.com if the alerts have a level equals or higher than 12.

Force forwarding an alert by email
----------------------------------

It's also possible to force the mail alert on the rule declaration. In order to do this, you need to use :ref:`option<rules_options>`

The possible values to this option are:

- alert_by_email: Always alert by email.
- no_email_alert: Never alert by email.
- no_log: Do not log this alert.

So for example this rule:

::

   <rule id="502" level="3">
     <if_sid>500</if_sid>
     <options>alert_by_email</options>
     <match>Ossec started</match>
     <description>Ossec server started.</description>
   </rule>

This will send an email everytime this rule is triggered. I doesn't matter the level minimum level configured on the ``<alerts>`` section in ``ossec.conf``


Daily report
------------
Daily reports are summaries of the alerts for the day. You can configure your own report. Configuration of report is done in the ``ossec.conf`` file using the ``report`` option. More information: :ref:`Report <reference_ossec_reports>`
::

 <ossec_config>
   <reports>
       <category>syscheck</category>
       <title>Daily report: File changes</title>
       <email_to>example@test.com</email_to>
   </reports>
 </ossec_config>

The above configuration will send a daily report of all :ref:`syscheck <manual_file_integrity>` alerts.

Rules may also be filtered by level, source, username, rule id, etc.

For example:
::

 <ossec_config>
   <reports>
       <level>10</level>
       <title>Daily report: Alerts with level higher than 10</title>
       <email_to>example@test.com</email_to>
   </reports>
 </ossec_config>

The above configuration will send a report with all rules that fired with a level higher than 10.

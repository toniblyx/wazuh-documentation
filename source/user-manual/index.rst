User manual
================

Welcome to the Wazuh user manual. Here you can learn how to configure and manage the solution components. This document includes a reference guide that includes a complete description of configuration options and command line tools.

.. note::

  In the same way that the main components of Wazuh are a fork of the renowned OSSEC HIDS project, so this user manual has been derived from the `OSSEC documentation <http://ossec.github.io/docs/>`_. Kudos to the OSSEC team for their huge contribution to the IT security community.
